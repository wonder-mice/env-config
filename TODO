* Fix defaults
Usage of ${var-default} substution sucks when default has spaces or other
complex things, and if put in "", "" will be part of substitution.

* What happens with settings file on linux?
New lines are not expanded.

* Add ag (silver search) and ctags (the good one)

* Use unset to remove temp variables

* Maybe restrictions on ENC_CONFIG_DIR path can be removed
Looks like there is no reason to check for complex substitutions and spaces.
No reason for path to be absolute.
Oh, forgot about readline... No still need that stuff :(

* Add annotated documentation support
Special type of comment, like
# @env-config-doc Current git branch name will be shown in bash command prompt
or
" @env-config-doc Using :A can switch between source and header files

* Will be nice to put all ENV_CONFIG_XXX settings in one place in install script
Some array of structs will be good. This will allow to annotate options and to
automatically generate help, default values, settings and features processing.

* Figure out how readline vi mode can be an install option
