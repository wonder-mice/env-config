* Bug/Feature - Conditional annotated documentation
Don't want to see that bash has git branch in prompt even when this option was disabled.
But it is hard to implement all complexity of conditional logic.
Maybe some simple xml-like sed prefilter? For example, will leave lines between this two
only when colors are disabled:
# <no-colors>
# </no-colors>

* Feature - Figure out how readline vi mode can be an install option

* Feature - Will be nice to put all ENV_CONFIG_XXX settings with in one place in install script
Want to put all information (feature name, description, corresponding shell var) about settings
in one place. Some array of structs will be good. This will allow to annotate options and to
automatically generate help, default values, settings and features processing.

* Feature - Maybe restrictions on ENC_CONFIG_DIR path can be removed
Looks like there is no reason to check for complex substitutions and spaces.
No reason for path to be absolute.
Oh, forgot about readline and its "~" substitution... No still need that stuff :(
