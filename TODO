* Maybe restrictions on ENC_CONFIG_DIR path can be removed
Looks like there is no reason to check for complex substitutions and spaces.
No reason for path to be absolute.
Oh, forgot about readline... No still need that stuff :(

* Will be nice to put all ENV_CONFIG_XXX settings in one place in install script
Some array of structs will be good. This will allow to annotate options and to
automatically generate help, default values, settings and features processing.

* Figure out how readline vi mode can be an install option
